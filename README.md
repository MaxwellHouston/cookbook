## About
This is a project I started to help my fiance keep track of, and easily access her recipes but it has grown into something larger. Now it will be used to help my family share all of their recipes and add new ones whenever they are created. Eventually I want it to be a good template for any recipe sharing site and can be interchanged with your own database of recipes easily.

## Project
Cookbook is built with the Next.js framework, Typescript, and Tailwind CSS. I am using Google Firebase to handle the database, file storage, and authentication for the app. 

## Set-up
Once completed I will make a write up to show how to use this as a template for your own project.
